== Summary

This section will examine Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository integration with Amazon S3.

The workshop environment created an FSx for Lustre file system with a data repository integrated with the "nasanex" bucket in the US West (Oregon) region. link:https://registry.opendata.aws/nasanex/[NASA NEX] is a part of the link:https://registry.opendata.aws/[Registry of Open Data on AWS] project and is a collection of Earth science datasets maintained by NASA, including climate change projections and satellite images of the Earth's surface.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below before continuing.

=== Connect to *Linux Instance*

. Open the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console.
+
TIP: *_Context-click (right-click)_* the link above and open the link in a new tab or window to make it easy to navigate between this github workshop and Amazon EC2 console.
+
. Make sure you are in the same *AWS Region* where you *_created_* your workshop environment.
. *_Select_* the EC2 instance created by the CloudFormation template. The name is "*Linux Instance*".
. *_Click_* the *Connect* button.
. *_Copy_* the SSH command and *_click_* *Close*.
. *_Open_* your *terminal* application and *_paste_* the SSH command in a terminal window.
. *_Follow_* the prompts to SSH into the instance.

=== Examine *s3://nasanex* data repository integration

*_Copy_*, *_paste_*, then *_execute_* the shell commands below in the SSH terminal session of *Linux Instance* to answer the following questions:

. Is the FSx for Lustre file system mounted?
+
[source,bash]
----
mount -t lustre

----
+
. How long does it take to list the entire file system?
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /fsx

----
+
. What file types did you see?
. How many files?
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /fsx --type f | wc -l

----
+
. How many directories?
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /fsx --type d | wc -l

----
+
. How many small files (< 512 KiB)?
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /fsx --type f --size -512k | wc -l

----
+
. How many large files (> 100 MiB)?
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /fsx --type f --size +100M | wc -l

----
+
. How many .nc, .hdf, .tif files?
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs find /fsx --type f --name *.nc | wc -l
time lfs find /fsx --type f --name *.hdf | wc -l
time lfs find /fsx --type f --name *.tif | wc -l

----
+
. How much metadata (MDT) has been loaded into the file system?
+
How much data (all the OSTs) has been loaded into the file system?
+
How much data storage capacity is available?
+
How many Metadata Targets (MDTs) are provisioned for the file system?
+
How much storage is provisioned, used, and available for the MDT?
+
How many Object Storage Targets (OSTs) are provisioned for the file system?
+
How much storage is provisioned, used, and available for each OST?
+
Examine the UUIDs of the MDT and OSTs. Compare the prefix of each UUID to the mount name of the file system. The mount name is found in the *Summary* section of the file system in the Amazon FSx console.
+
[source,bash]
----
time lfs df -h
